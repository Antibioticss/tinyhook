# tinyhook test

Here are some simple tests and examples to show the usage of tinyhook.

- `hook` includes inline hook examples
- `objc` includes Objective-C runtime hook examples

## build and run

```shell
make
cd hook && ./main
```

Use `make` to build, then run `main` executable in the folder.

Or directly run this, it will run all the tests.

```shell
make run
```

Note: `libtinyhook.a` should be built before building these tests.
