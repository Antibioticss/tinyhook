# Hooking

tinyhook implemented simple inline hooking and symbol interposing functions, supporting both `arm64` and `x86_64` architecture

Note that inline hooking/inserting only works on jailed iOS devices

## tiny_hook

```c
int tiny_hook(void *function, void *destination, void **origin);
```

Core **inline hook** function, replace a function with a new implementation

#### Parameters
 - `function` the address of the function to be hooked
 - `destination` your new implementation of the function
 - `origin` address of the original function pointer

#### Return Value

Return `0` on success

#### Discussion

`origin` can be `NULL` if you don't need to call the original function

## tiny_(un)hook_ex

Backup the hook to remove it later

```c
int tiny_hook_ex(th_bak_t *bak, void *function, void *destination, void **origin);

int tiny_unhook_ex(th_bak_t *bak);
```

#### Parameters
 - `bak` pointer to `th_bak_t` struct, which includes a backup of original function header

#### Return Value

Return `0` on success

#### Discussion

`tiny_hook_ex` and `tiny_unhook_ex` should be used in pairs

*You should not modify `th_bak_t` struct by yourself!!*

## tiny_interpose

**Interpose a symbol** in a given image

```c
int tiny_interpose(uint32_t image_index, const char *symbol_name, void *replacement);
```

#### Parameters
 - `image_index` the index to the image which includes the symbol
 - `symbol_name` raw symbol name (without demangling)
 - `replacement` your new implementation of the function

#### Return Value

Return `0` on success

#### Discussion

After interposing, all calls to the function with the `symbol_name` would be redirected to `replacement`

Which means, to call the original function, you just need to call it from the current image

This functions works similarly to `fishhook`, by replacing pointers in the imported symbol table

## tiny_insert

Insert a function call

```c
int tiny_insert(void *address, void *destination);
```

#### Parameters
 - `address` where to insert the function call
 - `destination` the destination of the call

#### Return Value

Return `0` on success

#### Discussion

This will insert a `bl`/`call` instruction at `address`  (if it's far it would be `adrp+blr`/`call [rip]`)

Usually used to replace an existing function call
